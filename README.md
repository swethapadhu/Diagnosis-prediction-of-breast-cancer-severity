### DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER

The goal of this project was to develop a breast cancer malignancy prediction algorithm that helps predict malignancy in future query images accurately and efficiently. 

The .m contains some feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms to predict the severity of breast cancer from mammogram images. The SVM classifier gave the best performance with an accuracy of 98%
